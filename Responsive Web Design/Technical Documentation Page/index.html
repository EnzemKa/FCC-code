						</header>
						<p>Roomba is a robot that cleans floors differently than the way most people clean their floors. Roomba uses its robot intelligence to efficiently clean the whole floor, under and around furniture and along walls.</p>
						<p>Roomba calculates the optimal cleaning path as it cleans and determines when to use its various cleaning behaviors:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Spiraling:</strong> Roomba uses a spiral motion to clean a concentrated area.</li>
							<li><strong>Wall Following:</strong> Roomba uses this technique to clean the full perimeter of the room and navigate around furniture and obstacles.</li>
							<li><strong>Room Crossing:</strong> Roomba crisscrosses the room to ensure full cleaning coverage.</li>
							<li><strong>Dirt Detection:</strong> When Roomba senses dirt, the blue Dirt Detect™ light is lit and Roomba cleans more intensely in that area.</li>
						</ul>
						<code>
							<dl class="row">
								<dt class="col-md-1"><kbd>TIP:</kbd></dt>
								<dd class="col-md-11">Roomba takes approximately 25 minutes to clean an average room and will pass over the same area of the floor multiple times to ensure total floor coverage.</dd>
							</dl>
						</code>
						<code>
							<dl class="row">
								<dt class="col-md-1"><kbd>TIP:</kbd></dt>
								<dd class="col-md-11">For most efficient cleaning, clear your floor of clutter and use a Virtual Wall to confine Roomba to one room.</dd>

		      	<header>
							<h1 class="display-3">Cleaning Modes</h1>
						</header>
						<p>Roomba will clean based on the cleaning mode you select. Roomba has three cleaning modes.</p>
						<ul> 
							<li><strong>Clean Mode</strong> <span class="text-secondary">(all models)</span>
								<br />Roomba automatically calculates the room size and adjusts its cleaning time appropriately. </li>							
							<li><strong>Spot Mode</strong> <span class="text-secondary">(all models)</span>
								<br />Roomba will spiral approximately three feet in diameter and then spiral back to where it started, intensely cleaning a localized area. </li>
							<li><strong>Scheduled Cleaning Mode</strong> <span class="text-secondary">(Models 550 and above)</span>
								<br />When a future cleaning time is programmed, Roomba enters Scheduled Cleaning Mode. When scheduled to clean, Roomba will occasionally flash its next cleaning time to remind you of its schedule. At the specified time, Roomba leaves its Home Base, cleans, and then returns to the Home Base to recharge when it’s done. </li>

		      <section class="tab-pane fade main-section" id="Cleaning_System" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="Cleaning_System-tab">
		      	<header>
							<h1 class="display-3">Cleaning System</h1>
						</header>
						<p>Roomba features a patented three-stage cleaning system.</p>
						<strong>Floor Surfaces</strong><br />
						<p>Roomba works on wood, carpet, tile, vinyl, and linoleum, and adjusts automatically to different floor types.
							<br />Roomba automatically senses stairs and other cliffs. Roomba might stall when confronting rounded edges and might slide over particularly slippery surfaces. Extremely dark-colored floors may contribute to Roomba’s cliff sensors working less effectively.</p>
						<strong>Anti-Tangle system</strong><br />
						<p>Roomba won’t get stuck on cords, carpet fringe or tassels. When Roomba senses it has picked up a cord or tassel, it will automatically stop its main brushes or side brush and try to escape. Roomba may make a clicking noise when anti-tangle is activated.</p>
		      </section>
		      <section class="tab-pane fade main-section" id="Cleaning_Bins" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="Cleaning_Bins-tab">
		      	<header>
							<h1 class="display-3">Cleaning Bins</h1>
						</header>
						<p>Roomba is compatible with two interchangeable cleaning bins.</p>
						<strong>Vacuum Cleaning Bin</strong><br />
						<p>The vacuum cleaning bin should be used for everyday cleaning. The dual action, counter-rotating brushes pick up debris, while the vacuum sucks up the dirt and dust.</p>
						<strong>High-Capacity Sweeper Bin</strong> <span class="text-secondary">(optional accessory for all models)</span><br />
						<p>The high-capacity sweeper bin can hold more debris than the vacuum cleaning bin. Use this bin when cleaning larger-than-usual amounts of dirt and dust, or when cleaning bigger pieces of debris.</p>

		      	<header>
							<h1 class="display-3">Battery Storage and Charging</h1>
						</header>
						<p>Roomba is powered by a rechargeable battery. Roomba’s battery can last for hundreds of cleaning cycles if cared for properly.</p>
						<strong>Battery Life</strong><br />
						<p>To extend the battery life, iRobot recommends always storing Roomba plugged in. For more details on how to maintain Roomba’s battery life, visit <a href="www.irobot.com/support" class="text-info">www.irobot.com/support</a>.</p>

								<dd class="col-md-11">For storage off the power supply, remove the battery from Roomba and store in a cool, dry place.</dd>
							</dl>
						</code> 
						<strong>Cleaning Time</strong><br />
						<p>You should fully charge Roomba’s battery before each cleaning cycle. When fully charged, Roomba’s battery will last for at least one full clean cycle.</p>
						<strong>16-Hour Refresh Charge</strong><br />
						<p>If Roomba has been left off the power supply or Home Base for an extended period, Roomba will initiate a special 16-hour charge cycle. This extensive charge refreshes Roomba’s battery and extends the battery life. While charging, Roomba’s “Clean” button will pulse quickly.<br />
						<span class="text-info">Note: For best results, do not interrupt this Refresh Charge.</span></p>
